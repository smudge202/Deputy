# Deputy

Deputy is a lightweight actor system that is designed specifically for the .Net Core. The main aims of the project are to: 

- Provide ease to consume abstractions, enabling effective testability
- Remove some of the nastiness seen in other frameworks such as Akka.Net
- Serve as a learning project for myself

If the project ends up being successful and helpful, I will release onto NuGet properly. 

You can follow the development of Deputy as it's being streamed over at [Twitch.Tv](http://www.twitch.tv/stuartblackler/).
